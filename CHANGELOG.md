## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2022-10-10

Next.js for Acquia CMS is now ready for production! With Next.js for Acquia CMS
you get an out-of-the-box Next.js application that connects easily to the Acquia
CMS default content model. Next.js is a framework built on top of React.js.

### Features

- **The full power of Next.js for Drupal**: Next.js for Acquia CMS is based on the popular Next.js for Drupal library. You get the full power of Next.js for Drupal with Next.js for Acquia CMS!
- **Image style integration**: On top of Next.js image optimization, you can leverage Drupal image styles. This allows you to use Drupal modules like Focal Point to customize how your images are rendered.
- **Helpful developer tooling**: Debugging issues with decoupled site integration can be challenging. To solve this, Next.js for Acquia CMS runs a pre-flight check on the development environment to ensure that the Next.js application integration is vitally compatible with the Drupal backend.

### Coming soon

- **Webform integration**: Create and edit your forms in Drupal just like you would edit any other type of content and the changes will be live instantly on the Next.js application!
- **Simplified authorization workflow**: We will release a simplified authorization workflow later this year to remove the need for a Next.js specific user on Drupal.
